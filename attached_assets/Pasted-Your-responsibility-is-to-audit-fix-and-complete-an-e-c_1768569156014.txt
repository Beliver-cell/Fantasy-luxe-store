🧭 EXECUTION ORDER (FOLLOW STRICTLY)
✅ STEP 1 — FULL MOBILE-FIRST UI AUDIT (ADMIN + FRONTEND)
Fix responsiveness:

Admin dashboard is not mobile-friendly → FIX

Frontend is not mobile-friendly → FIX

Ensure:

All buttons are tappable

Modals and forms fit small screens

Navigation works on mobile

No overflow or hidden actions

✅ STEP 2 — ADMIN PRODUCT & COLLECTION MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)

Add product images (multiple if supported)

Add product sizes:

Examples: 41 inch, 31–45 inch, S, M, L

Ensure uploaded images are:

stored correctly

returned by APIs

usable by frontend

No unused inputs. No missing fields.

✅ STEP 3 — IMAGE PIPELINE FIX (ADMIN → BACKEND → FRONTEND → HOME)

🚨 THIS IS CRITICAL AND MUST NOT BE SKIPPED

Current problem:

Products or collections added by admin

Text shows, but images do NOT appear on homepage or listings

You MUST:

Trace image upload flow:

Admin upload → backend storage → API response → frontend render

Fix:

Broken image URLs

Missing API fields

Incorrect frontend mapping

Collections must display:

Image

Category

Newly added products

Newly added collections

Fix any mismatch between admin data and frontend rendering

No repeated typing. No lost data.

✅ STEP 6 — SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY (HOME PAGE)

Fix search button:

Must search products

No dummy UI.

✅ STEP 7 — PAYMENT FLOW (FLUTTERWAVE — ZERO FAILURE)
Current issue:

Clicking Pay returns 401 Request Failed

Flutterwave secret key exists in env

You MUST:

Trace why 401 occurs

Ensure:

Public key used on frontend

Secret key used only on backend

Payment verification works

Confirm:

Clicking Pay opens Flutterwave

Successful payment creates order

Failed payment shows clean error

⚠️ Payment must never be a dead button
⚠️ Orders must not be created before success

✅ STEP 8 — ERROR HANDLING & USER EXPERIENCE

Replace console errors with user-friendly messages:

“Invalid email or password”

“Payment failed, try again”

“Network error”

Server logs remain detailed

Client messages remain clean

✅ STEP 9 — DEAD END & BROKEN FLOW AUDIT

You MUST:

Click every button

Submit every form

Trigger every modal

Fix:

Dead buttons

Broken links

Missing API calls

Fake loaders

If it exists → it works.

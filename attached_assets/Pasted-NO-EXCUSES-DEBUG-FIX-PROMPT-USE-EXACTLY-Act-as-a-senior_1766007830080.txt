NO-EXCUSES DEBUG & FIX PROMPT (USE EXACTLY)

Act as a senior full-stack engineer responsible for production systems.
My e-commerce website has critical admin failures.
You must fix the root causes, not hide them behind error messages.

CORE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Do NOT silence issues by adding alerts, toasts, console spam, or UI error messages

Do NOT add temporary guards or fake success states

If an error appears, eliminate the cause, not the message

Final result must work with zero visible errors

PROBLEMS
1. PRODUCT CREATION (ADMIN)

“Add Product” button does not trigger properly

Product is NOT saved to database

Product does NOT appear on frontend

Admin currently sees error messages instead of working behavior

2. CATEGORY MANAGEMENT (ADMIN)

Admin cannot reliably:

Create categories

Delete categories

Category updates do NOT sync immediately across admin + frontend

REQUIRED ACTIONS (DO NOT SKIP)
1. BUTTON & FORM FIX (ROOT CAUSE ONLY)

Verify:

Button uses type="submit"

Button is inside a valid <form>

onSubmit handler exists and executes

Remove:

Broken preventDefault() usage

Disabled states blocking submission

Invalid state bindings

Ensure clicking always sends a request when form is valid

2. FRONTEND → BACKEND PIPELINE

Verify API endpoint:

Exact URL

POST method

Correct request body

Fix mismatches between:

Frontend payload

Backend expected schema

Ensure request succeeds without triggering any frontend error UI

3. BACKEND PRODUCT LOGIC

Ensure backend:

Receives request correctly

Validates required fields properly

Saves product successfully

Remove:

Over-strict validation causing false errors

Silent failures

Backend must return a clean success response

4. DATABASE CONSISTENCY

Verify product records are created

Ensure:

No required fields are null

Schema matches frontend fields exactly

Fix:

Column / field mismatches

Type conflicts

5. FRONTEND PRODUCT DISPLAY

Ensure frontend:

Fetches products from correct endpoint

Updates state immediately after product creation

Re-renders without refresh

No error messages should appear during normal flow

CATEGORY MANAGEMENT (ADMIN-ONLY)

Implement FULL CRUD, cleanly:

Admin must:

Create categories

Delete categories

Fetch categories

Technical rules:

Categories stored in database

Products reference category by ID

Deleting a category:

Block deletion if products exist (safe default)

No frontend errors allowed during category operations

UI behavior:

Category dropdown updates instantly

Category list is admin-only

No reload required

FINAL VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)

Perform these steps and confirm ALL pass:

Add product from admin

Product saves to database

Product appears on frontend

No error messages shown

Create category → appears immediately

Delete category → system remains stable

Do NOT explain.
Do NOT comment.
Do NOT suggest alternatives.

Fix the system until it works cleanly with zero visible errors.
